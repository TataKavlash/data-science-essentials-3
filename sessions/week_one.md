## Week 1
What is Data Science?

 - Coding Skills/Statistics/Domain Expertise
 - The Data Science Process
 - Examples of Data Science in the world

<<<<<<< HEAD
Understanding the Question + Getting Data

- Critical thinking and active questioning
- Acquiring domain expertise
- Articulating the question
- Review of code for today (pandas API)

**Coding tasks:** Get and begin cleaning data.  

 1.  Create a DataFrame, `ha_costs_df`, from the `mmd_heart_attack_data.csv` file.
 
		- Examine the first 5 rows and the last five rows of the TN heart attack data.
		- Check the data types of each column by using `.info`.
		- Keep only the rows where facilities are in TN.
		- Print the dimensions of the resulting dataframe.
		- How many TN counties are represented in the heart attack costs data?
		- How many counties are classified as urban? How many as rural?
		
 2.  Create a DataFrame, `cancer_costs_df`, from the `mmd_cancer_data.csv` file.
 
		- Look at the head and tail of the DataFrame.
		- Keep only the rows where facilities are in TN.
		- Print the dimensions of the data. How many TN counties are represented in the cancer costs data?
		- You should have found that the datasets have a different number of counties. Bonus: Can you figure out which counties are missing from one of the datasets?

 2.  Create a DataFrame, `income_df`, from the `irs_county_2016.csv` file.
 
        - Keep only the data that pertains to Tennessee.
        - Look at the head and the tail.
        - Print the shape.
        - Keep only the following columns:  `['STATE', 'COUNTYNAME', 'agi_stub', 'N1', 'mars1', 'MARS2', 'MARS4', 'N2', 'NUMDEP', 'ELDERLY', 'A00100', 'N02650', 'A02650', 'N02300', 'A02300']`
        - rename those columns: `['state', 'county', 'income_bucket', 'return_count', 'single_returns', 'joint_returns', 'head_of_house_returns', 'exemptions', 'dependents', 'elderly', 'agi', 'returns_with_total_inc','total_inc_amt', 'returns_with_unemployment', 'unemployment_comp']`
